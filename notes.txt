* React components take in values as parameters, props, and returns a hierarchy of views.



* Immutability--setting entire state instead of subcomponents of it--leads to pure components.
* A subcomponent into which props of a parent are passed is a "controlled component" (haughty name for a child). Also a "function component", a component with no state of its own (this would probably be a private class in c#/bridge.
* Create state in constructor:
	class SomeComponent extends React.Component
	{
		constructor(props){
			this.state = {
				someAttribute=1,
				thing = "stuff",
			};
		}
	
	}

* Function components have no state, only a render() function:
		function Square(props) {
		  return (
			<button className="square" onClick={props.onClick}>
			  {props.value}
			</button>
		  );
		}
